The traffic is unpredictable for subsequent monthly sales events, which impacts the sales forecast. The company needs to maintain performance when there is an unpredictable increase in traffic. Which solution resolves this issue in the MOST cost-effective way?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.",
        "B": "Enable auto scaling for the PostgreSQL database on the EC2 instance to accommodate increased usage.",
        "C": "Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with a larger instance type.",
        "D": "Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Redshift to accommodate increased usage."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Aurora Serverless is a serverless relational database engine provided by Amazon. It automatically adjusts its capacity based on actual usage, allowing it to scale up or down as needed. Aurora Serverless v2 builds upon the original Aurora Serverless model with additional features for even more efficient scaling."

      "question": "A company hosts an internal serverless application on AWS by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The company’s employees report issues with high latency when they begin using the application each day. The company wants to reduce latency. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase the API Gateway throttling limit.",
        "B": "Set up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin to use the application each day.",
        "C": "Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to initiate a Lambda function as a target for the alarm at the beginning of each day.",
        "D": "Increase the Lambda function memory."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lambda Provisioned Concurrency: Provisioned concurrency is the number of simultaneous executions that your function can handle. By setting up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin using the application, you are proactively ensuring that there are enough resources available to handle the expected load."

      "question": "Aresearch company uses on-premises devices to generate data for analysis. The company wants to use the AWS Cloud to analyze the data. The devices generate .csv Files and support writing the data to an SMB File share. Company analysts must be able to use SQL commands to query the data. The analysts will run queries periodically throughout the day. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose three.)",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "C. Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the data that is in Amazon S3.\nF. Setup Amazon Athena to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.\nThis step allows you to seamlessly integrate on-premises devices with AWS S3, providing a scalable and cost-effective storage solution. The AWS Storage Gateway in S3 File Gateway mode enables you to write data from on-premises devices to S3.\nAWS Glue can discover, catalog, and transform data from S3. By setting up a Glue crawler, you create a table schema based on the .csv files in S3. This step prepares the data for analysis.\nAmazon Athena allows you to run SQL queries directly on the data stored in S3 without the need for a dedicated database. You can create databases and tables in Athena based on the cataloged data using Glue."

      "question": "A company is planning to migrate aTCP-based application into the company's VPC. The application is publicly accessible on anonstandard TCP port through ahardware appliance in the company's data center. This public endpoint can process up to 3 million requests per second with low latency. The company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS. What should A solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.",
        "B": "Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the ALB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Network Load Balancer (NLB): It operates at the connection level (Layer 4) and is well-suited for TCP traffic. It can handle millions of requests per second with minimal latency.\nNLB allows you to configure the listener for the specific TCP port that the application requires, ensuring compatibility with the nonstandard TCP port used by the application."
