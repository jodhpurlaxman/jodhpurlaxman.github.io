      "question": "Atransaction processing company has weekly scripted batch jobs that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The number of transactions can vary, but the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run is at least 60%. The company needs to provision the capacity 30 minutes before the jobs run. Currently, engineers complete this task by manually modifying the Auto Scaling group parameters. The company does not have the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts. The company needs an automated way to modify the Auto Scaling group’sdesired capacity. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Create a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Configure the policy to scale based on the CPU utilization metric. Set the target value for the metric to 60%.",
        "B": "Create a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. Set the recurrence to weekly. Set the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run.",

      "explanation": "In general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature."
