      "question": "A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Option C, which involves copying the data to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to use Amazon EFS for document storage, is the most appropriate solution to ensure users can see all their documents at once in the duplicated architecture. Amazon EFS provides scalability, availability, and shared access, allowing both EC2 instances to access and synchronize the documents seamlessly. Unlike EBS volumes or snapshots, which cannot be shared in real time across multiple instances and Availability Zones, Amazon EFS allows both EC2 instances to access the same file system simultaneously, ensuring all users see the same set of documents regardless of which instance serves their request."

      "question": "A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability. Which solution meets these requirements?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Con\u0000gure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A good practice is to also add message attributes when publishing to SNS. Each SQS subscription can have a filter policy that matches only the messages it cares about, so that only relevant messages are delivered to each SQS queue, and consumers only see/process what they need.\nan SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.\nIt's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B: This option provides a decoupled architecture where the jobs are sent to an SQS queue. The compute nodes (EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group) can then process these jobs. Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue (the number of messages) allows the architecture to adapt to variable workloads, scaling out when the queue depth increases and scaling in when the depth decreases."

This includes information about accepted and rejected connections. To monitor RDP or SSH access, you can analyze these logs.\nCloudWatch Logs:** By publishing VPC flow logs to CloudWatch Logs, you can analyze the logs using metric filters to extract relevant information.\nMetric Filters:** Create metric filters to match the patterns corresponding to RDP or SSH access in the CloudWatch Logs. For example, you can create metric filters that look for specific keywords or patterns related to RDP or SSH connections.\nCloudWatch Metric Alarm:** Set up CloudWatch metric alarms based on the metric filters. When the alarm is triggered (indicating that RDP or SSH access has been detected), it can take a notification action, such as sending a notification to the operations team via Amazon SNS."
