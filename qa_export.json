This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all of the accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element.\nproposes adding the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy. This would limit access to the S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations, as the aws PrincipalOrgID condition key can check if the request is coming from within the organization."

However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway."

      "explanation": "Option C, which involves copying the data to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to use Amazon EFS for document storage, is the most appropriate solution to ensure users can see all their documents at once in the duplicated architecture. Amazon EFS provides scalability, availability, and shared access, allowing both EC2 instances to access and synchronize the documents seamlessly. Unlike EBS volumes or snapshots, which cannot be shared in real time across multiple instances and Availability Zones, Amazon EFS allows both EC2 instances to access the same file system simultaneously, ensuring all users see the same set of documents regardless of which instance serves their request."

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A good practice is to also add message attributes when publishing to SNS. Each SQS subscription can have a filter policy that matches only the messages it cares about, so that only relevant messages are delivered to each SQS queue, and consumers only see/process what they need.\nan SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.\nIt's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B: This option provides a decoupled architecture where the jobs are sent to an SQS queue. The compute nodes (EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group) can then process these jobs. Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue (the number of messages) allows the architecture to adapt to variable workloads, scaling out when the queue depth increases and scaling in when the depth decreases."

Files written to the file share are automatically saved as S3 objects. With S3 Lifecycle policies, you can transition objects between storage classes. Transitioning to Glacier Deep Archive is suitable for rarely accessed files. This solution addresses both the storage capacity and lifecycle management requirements."

With Multi-AZ deployment, the database is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.\nAurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand.

Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.\nUsing Amazon S3 to host static content and Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content can provide high performance and scale for websites with millions of requests each hour. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can be used to build scalable and highly available backend APIs to support the website, and Amazon DynamoDB can be used to store the data. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to meet demand."

      "explanation": "Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.\nS3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region."

To monitor RDP or SSH access, you can analyze these logs.\nCloudWatch Logs:** By publishing VPC flow logs to CloudWatch Logs, you can analyze the logs using metric filters to extract relevant information.\nMetric Filters:** Create metric filters to match the patterns corresponding to RDP or SSH access in the CloudWatch Logs. For example, you can create metric filters that look for specific keywords or patterns related to RDP or SSH connections.\nCloudWatch Metric Alarm:** Set up CloudWatch metric alarms based on the metric filters.

While they offer flexibility, they are usually more expensive compared to other purchasing options.\nSpot Instances: These are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at a lower price compared to On-Demand Instances. However, they can be terminated by AWS with little notice if the capacity is needed elsewhere. Spot Instances are suitable for workloads that are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions."

ECS services can efficiently handle the startup process of fetching model data from Amazon S3 and loading it into memory.\nApplication Load Balancer (ALB): The ALB is used to direct requests from the API to the ECS services. ALB provides advanced routing capabilities and can handle the asynchronous API requirements.\nAWS App Mesh: AWS App Mesh can be used to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size.

RIs are a commitment to a consistent usage pattern, making them suitable for instances that need to run continuously.\nSpot Instances for Backend Nodes: Spot Instances are a cost-effective option for workloads that can be interrupted or are flexible regarding availability. As the number of backend nodes varies during the day, using Spot Instances allows you to take advantage of spare capacity at a lower cost.
